// You are an overworked conference organiser for Most Popular Conference of The Year.
// On the morning of the conference, you realise that no-one has created name labels for the attendees. The horror!
// The doors open soon, but luckily you can print labels as your laptop is connected to a printer.
// To preserve privacy, you need to print only the first name of each attendee. Create a function called fullName that
// parses out the first name of each attendee.

function fullName()

module.exports = { fullName };
